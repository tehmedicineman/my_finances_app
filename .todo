	block writes to only authorized users
		probably going to authorize via a field... my idea for an auto-fill chrome field feels right since i can easily do stuff from my phone
site
	:general:
		create app to manage 'finance' data once we get it, i only want to run data loads intermittently
			:source -- this is where the data loaded from ::load() is stored so it can be used elsewhere (data is immutable, requires being re-loaded otherwise)
			::load() -- hits the server to pull back everything
			::group(grouping) -- grouping determines how to split the data (ex: name, categories), data source is the main source, returns grouped data
			::filter(filter, data) -- filters data passed into based on filter passed, data source is passed in, returns filtered data
	:page:listing
		displays the financial data in a tabular format
		by default displays everything, can be grouped or filtered from here to change what is in the table
	:page:stats
		displays stats and comparison data
		by default doesn't display anything (there is no 0 state wihtout input)
		when given a group to source by it will then take all members grouped and run different comparison functionality on them
			ex: group by date::month will give you stats per month with comparisons
			ex: group by name will give you stats on each item recorded with comparisons
	:page:predict
		displays a set of predictions based on inserted data
		by default doesn't display anything (there is no 0 state without input)
		when given an input it will take all 'knowable' groups and run predictions
			ex: given a name of 'Yogurt' will go through and predict cost per item, cost per month, frequency->next purchase time... etc, not sure on all this yet, its a work in progress
